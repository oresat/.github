# Welcome to OreSat!

OreSat is a completely open source CubeSat project meant for interdisciplinary teams of students. We're at [Portland State University](https://www.pdx.edu/), but we have tons of collaborators including [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/), [University of Oregon](https://www.uoregon.edu/), [University of Maryland Baltimore County](https://esi.umbc.edu/), [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/mullard-space-science-laboratory), [Cal Poly Pomona](https://www.cpp.edu/engineering/labs/bronco-space-lab.shtml), and many more! 

We have [Oregon's first satellite in space right now](https://www.oresat.org/satellites/oresat0), and are working on two more.

Designing, building, and testing CubeSats isn't easy, but OMG we're going to space. So get involved! Even if you're not involved with PSU at all, we could use your help. 

**Here's how to [Get Started!](https://github.com/oresat/getting-started)**

Email oresat@pdx.edu if you have any questions about ramping up or getting involved!
